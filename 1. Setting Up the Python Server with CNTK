Since CNTK (Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit) is primarily a Python-based machine learning library, we start by setting up a Python server to handle the image processing tasks.

Step 1.1: Install Required Python Packages
You need to install:

cntk: The core AI library that allows you to load and run machine learning models.
flask: A lightweight web server to handle requests from the Next.js front-end.
pillow: For handling and processing image files.

>> pip install cntk flask pillow
