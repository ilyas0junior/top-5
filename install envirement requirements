Step 1: Set Up a Python Server with CNTK

>> Install CNTK and Flask

Step 2: Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:

>> pip install cntk flask pillow

Step 3: Run the Python Server

>> python server.py

Step 4: Install Dependencies

>> npm install @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow-models/mobilenet next react react-dom

Step 5: Create the Next.js Front-End. So now, in your Next.js application, modify the code to communicate with the Python server. Install Axios (for making HTTP requests):

>> npm install axios

Step 6: Start the Next.js Application

>> npm run dev
